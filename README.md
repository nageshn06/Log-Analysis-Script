# Log-Analysis-Script
This log file analysis parses server logs to extract key insights: it identifies the number of requests made by each IP address, highlights the most frequently accessed endpoint, and detects suspicious activities like repeated failed login attempts. The results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.
